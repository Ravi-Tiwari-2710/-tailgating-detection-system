# -tailgating-detection-system

The system is design to provide security from an unauthorized excess  or tailgating. It works on the machine learning algorithm which can detect the faces and recognize them as authorized or not. It takes  very less data for the algorithm to work and it gives very high accuracy of nearly 99.93%. 
It does not require any extra hardware component other than camera and an alarm.
It reduces the human effort/work force and provide high accuracy results and it also inform the concern security staff members whenever tailgating detected so that right action can be taken in time.
It also captures the attendance of authorized persons with time of entry which reduces extra system requirement for attendance records.
