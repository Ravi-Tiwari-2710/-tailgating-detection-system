# -tailgating-detection-system

It is a system which can detect tailgating (entry without authorization) of a person through a CCTV video clip.
It uses machine learning algorithm for face recognition of a person entering in a building and then check whether the person is authorized or not by comparing his/her image by the images present in the given database.
If the person recognize as unauthorized than it will triggered the alarm and also inform the concern security members.
If the person is authorized than it will capture the time of entering and take the attendance.

The system is design to provide security from an unauthorized excess or tailgating. It works on the machine learning algorithm which can detect the faces and recognize them as authorized or not. It takes very less data for the algorithm to work and it gives very high accuracy of nearly 99.93%. 
It does not require any extra hardware component other than camera and an alarm.
It reduces the human effort/work force and provide high accuracy results and it also inform the concern security staff members whenever tailgating detected so that right action can be taken in time.
It also captures the attendance of authorized persons with time of entry which reduces extra system requirement for attendance records.
